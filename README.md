# R5R_Installer
Made by Kairi#0010 ; a few lines(a lot) of code taken from I-Am-Zee's Installer.<br/>
Hey<br/>
This is an installer is made for R5Reloaded.<br/>
Some(Most) of the code is from I-Am-Zee(https://www.github.com/I-Am-Zee)<br/>
If you stop the downloading, you need to go into:%APPDATA% -> Local -> Temp -> BitSwarm and delete the 2 folders inside of it, same with the download folder where you are downloading it to.<br/> For ex. D:/ApexR5; the app will make an R5PC_xyzetcetc folder, delete that and the temp folder next to it.<br/> No need to delete ApexR5 folder.<br/> Could also do that if that is more easier for you.
